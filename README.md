# World_Life_Expectancy_Analysis
A data analyst project analyzing global life expectancy data to identify key determinants and provide insights for public health policies using Python, SQL, and visualization tools.
This repository contains my data analysis project for an advanced data science course, focused on exploring factors affecting life expectancy across different countries. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover insights into socio-economic, health, and environmental determinants of life expectancy.
Key Features

    Data Cleaning: Ensure data integrity by handling missing values and outliers.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution and key factors influencing life expectancy.
    Correlation Analysis: Identify significant relationships between life expectancy and various indicators.
    Interactive Visualizations: Reveal insights into global health trends and determinants of life expectancy.

Skills Showcased

    Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    SQL: Data cleaning and preprocessing
    Data Visualization: Tableau
    Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
    Version Control: Git and GitHub

Findings from this project were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation, also available in this repository, demonstrating the application of data analysis to global health challenges.
Project Overview
Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the factors influencing life expectancy across different countries and regions. By analyzing various socio-economic, health, and environmental factors, the project aims to identify key determinants of life expectancy and provide insights that can inform public health policies and initiatives.
Objectives

    Analyze the provided dataset to understand the factors influencing life expectancy.
    Identify the most significant determinants of life expectancy across different countries and regions.
    Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve public health policies and initiatives.

Project Description

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing life expectancy data along with various socio-economic, health, and environmental indicators for different countries. Key activities include:

    Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
    Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and key factors influencing life expectancy.
    Visualizing the data to communicate the findings effectively.
    Providing recommendations based on the analysis to inform public health policies and initiatives.

Metrics Evaluated

    Life Expectancy: The average number of years a person is expected to live.
    Socio-Economic Indicators: Factors such as GDP, education levels, and income.
    Health Indicators: Factors such as infant mortality rate, health expenditure, and prevalence of diseases.
    Environmental Indicators: Factors such as air quality, access to clean water, and sanitation.

Evaluations Conducted

    Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data integrity.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of life expectancy and its relationship with various socio-economic, health, and environmental factors.
    Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between life expectancy and other variables to determine the most significant factors.
    Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to visualize the data and communicate the findings effectively.

Key Findings

    Socio-Economic Factors: Higher GDP, better education levels, and higher income are positively correlated with higher life expectancy.
    Health Indicators: Lower infant mortality rates, higher health expenditure, and lower prevalence of diseases are associated with higher life expectancy.
    Environmental Factors: Better air quality, access to clean water, and improved sanitation contribute to higher life expectancy.

Recommendations

    Invest in Healthcare: Increase health expenditure to improve healthcare infrastructure and services, which can reduce mortality rates and improve overall life expectancy.
    Enhance Education: Invest in education to improve literacy rates and education levels, which are linked to better health outcomes and higher life expectancy.
    Improve Environmental Conditions: Implement policies to improve air quality, provide access to clean water, and enhance sanitation facilities to boost life expectancy.
